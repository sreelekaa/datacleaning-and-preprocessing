# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing for Beginners
# Introduction
This project is designed to help beginners understand the basics of data cleaning and preprocessing. Data cleaning is the process of identifying and correcting errors or inconsistencies in a dataset. Preprocessing involves transforming raw data into a more understandable and usable format for machine learning models.
# 📚 Key Concepts Explained Simply
# 🔹 Data Cleaning:
Data cleaning means fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, missing, or duplicate data from your dataset. It's an important step before doing any kind of analysis or machine learning.

# 🔹 Data Preprocessing:
Preprocessing is like getting the data ready for use. This includes cleaning, converting data types, scaling values, encoding categories, etc.

# 🔹 Missing or Null Values:
Missing/Null values are empty cells in the dataset.

In Python using pandas, these are shown as NaN (Not a Number).

They can happen if data wasn’t recorded, got lost, or wasn’t collected properly.

# 🔹 Normalization:
Normalization means scaling data between 0 and 1 so that all features have the same scale and big numbers don’t dominate smaller ones.

# 🔹 Standardization:
Standardization means rescaling the data so it has a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. It helps algorithms that assume data is normally distributed.

# 🛠️ Project Workflow

# 1️⃣ Dataset Information & Missing Values
Start by understanding your dataset: What columns it has, how many entries are missing, and what types of values each column contains. Then handle missing values by either removing them or filling them in with appropriate values.

# 2️⃣ Feature Selection
Not all columns are useful. Select the important ones that actually help in analysis or prediction. This reduces noise and improves results.

# 3️⃣ Data Scaling
After selecting features, apply normalization or standardization so that all values are on a similar scale. This helps models learn better and faster.

# 4️⃣ Outlier Removal
Outliers are values that are very different from others. They can mislead your analysis. A boxplot helps you see these outliers. In this project, outliers were removed to improve the quality of the data.

# 📊 Final Result
At the end of this project, we display a clean dataset using a boxplot that shows no outliers. This means the data is balanced and ready for analysis or model training.
